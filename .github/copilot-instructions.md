This is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server project for movie ticket booking. The server provides tools to book movie tickets for different groups:
- Friends group (4 people)
- Relatives
- Whole class
- Family

You can find more info and examples at https://modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt

Additional reference: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/create-python-server

## Project Guidelines
- Use the FastMCP framework for implementing tools
- Follow the established MCP server patterns from the Python SDK
- All tools should include print statements for API interactions (no actual API calls)
- Focus on simulating the booking process flow
- Use appropriate typing and documentation for all functions
